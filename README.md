Concurrent REST API example using spring boot powered by MongoDB. 
For learning purposes proper concurrency is being implemented.

## Functionalities

-   Retrieval of flight details and member enrollment
-   Authentication backed by JWT (not yet fully implemented)

## TO-DO list
-   Storing invalid tokens using redis until their expiration dates in order to avoid illegal access.
-   Full API testing results will be provided once the application will have been completed
-   Performance tests will be planned to do using JMeter
-   Building service, database and UI using Docker from scratch
-   Automatic deployment will be handled by Jenkins
